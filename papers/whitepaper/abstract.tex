        In this work, we present Ergo, a new flexible and secure decentralized blockchain protocol.
        Ergo is designed to be a platform for applications with the main focus to provide
        an efficient, secure and easy way to implement financial contracts.

        To achieve this goal, Ergo includes various technical and economic improvements to existed
        blockchain solutions.
        Every coin in Ergo is protected by a program in ErgoScript, which is
        a powerful and protocol-friendly scripting language based on $\Sigma$-protocols.
        It specifies conditions under which a coin can be used: who can spend them,
        when, under what external conditions, to whom, and so on.

        Extended support of light nodes makes Ergo friendly for end users and allows to run
        contracts on commodity hardware without any trust.
        To be useful in the long-term, Ergo is following survivability approach --- it uses
        widely-researched solutions that are not going to result in security issues in the future,
        while also prevents performance degradation over time with the new economic model.

        Finally, Ergo is a self-amendable protocol, that allows to absorb new ideas and
        improve itself in the future.
