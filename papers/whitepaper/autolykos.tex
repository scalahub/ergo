The core component of any blockchain system is its consensus protocol and Ergo utilizes a self-developed
unique PoW protocol called the Autolykos Consensus Protocol further described below.
Despite extensive research of possible alternatives to the original Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocol
with the longest chain rule,
is still in demand due to simplicity, high-security guarantees, and friendliness to light clients.
However, a decade of extensive testing revealed several problems of the original one-CPU-one-vote idea.

First known problem of PoW is that development of specialized hardware (ASIC) allows
a small group of ASIC-equipped miners to solve PoW puzzles orders of magnitude faster and more efficiently
than everyone else. This problem can be solved with the help of memory-hard PoW schemes,
that reduce the disparity between the ASICs and commodity hardware. The most promising approach here
is to use asymmetric memory-hard PoW schemes that require significantly less memory
to verify a solution than to find it~\cite{biryukov2017equihash,ethHash}.

The second known threat to a PoW network decentralization is that even big miners trend to unite in
mining pools, leading to a situation when just a few pool operators (5 in Bitcoin, 2 in Ethereum
at the time of writing) control more than 51\% of computational power.
Although the problem has already been discussed in the community, no practical solutions were
implemented before \Ergo{}.


Ergo PoW protocol, Autolykos~\cite{Ergopow}, is the first consensus protocol, that is both memory-hard
and pool-resistant.
Autolykos is based on one list $k$-sum problem: miner should find
$k=32$ elements from the pre-defined list $R$ of size $N=2^{26}$~(which have a size of 2 Gb),
such that $\sum_{j \in J} r_{j} - sk = d$ is in the interval $\{-b,\dots,0,\dots,b\mod q\}$.
Elements of list $R$ are obtained as a result of one-way computation from index $i$,
two miner public keys $pk,w$ and hash of block header $m$ as $r_i=H(i||M||pk||m||w)$,
where $H$ is a hash function which returns the values in $\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z}$ and
$M$ is a static big message that is used to make hash calculation slower.
Also, a set of element indexes $J$ is to be obtained
by one-way pseudo-random function $genIndexes$, that prevents possible solutions
search optimizations.

Thus we assume that the only option for a miner is to use the simple brute-force algorithm~\ref{alg:prove} to
create a valid block.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
    \caption{Block mining}
    \label{alg:prove}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
        \State \textbf{Input}: upcoming block header hash $m$, key pair $pk=g^{sk}$
        \State Generate randomly a new key pair $w=g^x$
        \State Calculate $r_{i \in [0,N)}=H(i||M||pk||m||w)$
        \While{$true$}
        \LetRnd{$nonce$}{$\mathsf{rand}$}
        \Let{$J$}{$genIndexes(m||nonce)$}
        \Let{$d$}{$\sum_{j \in J}{r_j} \cdot x - sk \mod q$}
        \If{$d < b$}
        \State \Return $(m,pk,w,nonce,d)$
        \EndIf
        \EndWhile
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Note that although the mining process utilizes private keys, the solution itself
only contains public keys. Solution verification can be performed by Alg.~\ref{alg:verify}.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
    \caption{Solution verification}
    \label{alg:verify}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
        \State \textbf{Input}: $m,pk,w,nonce,d$
        \State require $d < b$
        \State require $pk,w\in \mathbb{G}$ and $pk,w \ne e$
        \Let{$J$}{$genIndexes(m||nonce)$}
        \Let{$f$}{$\sum_{j \in J} H(j||M||pk||m||w)$}
        \State require $w^f = g^d \cdot pk$
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

This approach prevents mining pool formation, as soon as a miner that found a correct solution
can always try to steal the block reward as far as he knows the secret key $sk$. On the other hand,
it is secure to reveal a single solution, as soon as it only operates with public keys and reveals only one
linear relation between 2 secrets $sk, w$.

Memory-hardness follows from the fact that Algorithm~\ref{alg:prove} requires to keep
the whole list $R$ during the main loop execution.
Every list element takes 32 bytes, so the whole list of $N$ elements
takes $N \cdot 32 = 2 Gb$ of memory.
Miner can try to reduce memory requirements by calculating these elements ``on fly''
without keeping them in memory, however, in such a case he'll need to calculate the same
hash $H$ multiple~(for about $10^4$ for modern GPUs) times, reducing miner's efficiency and profit.

Calculating the list $R$ is also quite a heavy computational task: our initial implementation~\cite{ergoMiner}
consumes ~25 seconds on Nvidia GTX 1070 to fill all the $2^{26}$ elements of the list.
This part, however, may be optimized if a miner also stores a list of unfinalized hashes $u_{i \in [0,N)}=H(i||M||pk)$
in memory, consuming 5 more Gigabytes of it. In such a case, work to calculate unfinalized hashes should
be done only once during mining initialization while finalizing them and filling the list $R$
for the new header only consumes milliseconds~(about 50 ms on Nvidia GTX 1070).

Target parameter $b$ is built-in into the puzzle itself
and is adjusted to the current network hash rate via difficulty adjustment
algorithm~\cite{meshkov2017short} to keep time interval between block close to 2 minutes.
This algorithm is trying to predict the hash rate of an upcoming 1024 block length epoch
based on data from the previous 8 epochs via well-known linear least squares method,
to predict it better than the usual difficulty adjustment algorithm while also makes possible
``coin-hopping'' attacks less profitable.
